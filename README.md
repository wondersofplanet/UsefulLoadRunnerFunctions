 simple C program that calculates and displays the current time and the time 5 days before it in epoch format. The program utilizes the time.h header file to access time-related functions and the stdio.h header file for standard input and output operations.

By running this program, users can quickly obtain the current time and a reference point in the past, specifically 5 days earlier, represented in seconds since the UNIX epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). This functionality can be useful in various applications requiring time-based calculations or timestamp logging.

made for use loadrunner, very useful code snippet.
